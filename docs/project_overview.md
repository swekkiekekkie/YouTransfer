# Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a direct file transfer application that allows users to send large files directly between computers over a network, bypassing third-party services like WeTransfer. This application will address several technical challenges, including NAT traversal, firewall configurations, and secure data transfer.

### Key Features

1. **Direct Peer-to-Peer File Transfer**: Enable users to transfer files directly without relying on intermediary servers, ensuring faster and more private exchanges.

2. **NAT Traversal**: Implement techniques such as STUN and TURN to facilitate connections between users behind NAT routers, ensuring seamless peer-to-peer communication.

3. **Security and Encryption**: Use SSL/TLS protocols to encrypt data during transfer, protecting it from interception and unauthorized access.

4. **Error Handling and Resume Capability**: Incorporate mechanisms to handle interruptions in file transfers, allowing users to resume from the last successful point.

5. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Ensure the application works across different operating systems, providing a consistent user experience.

### Technical Considerations

- **Transport Protocols**: Utilize TCP for reliable data delivery, with potential exploration of UDP for low-latency scenarios.
- **Application Layer Protocols**: Consider HTTP/HTTPS for firewall-friendly transfers or develop a custom protocol tailored to specific needs.
- **Programming Languages**: Leverage languages with strong network programming support, such as Python, Java, or C++.
- **User Interface**: Design a simple and intuitive UI for file selection and transfer progress monitoring.

### Development Roadmap

1. **Research and Planning**: Investigate existing open-source projects and define the application's features and security measures.
2. **Prototype Development**: Create a basic prototype focusing on core functionalities like file transfer and NAT traversal.
3. **Testing and Optimization**: Conduct thorough testing to ensure security, reliability, and performance across various network conditions.
4. **Deployment and Maintenance**: Release the application with regular updates and technical support to address emerging security threats and user feedback.

### Conclusion

Developing a custom file transfer application involves complex networking and security challenges. While existing tools may suffice for general use, a tailored solution can offer enhanced privacy and control over data transfers. Prioritizing security and leveraging existing protocols and libraries will be crucial to the project's success.
